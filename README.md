# Task-1-Data-Cleaning
Titanic Dataset - Data cleaning, handling nulls, encoding, feature scaling.
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning and analysis.

---

# Objective

Clean raw data by:
- Handling missing values
- Dropping unusable features
- Preparing the data for encoding and scaling

---

# Tools Used

- Python üêç
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visuals)
- Jupyter Notebook

# Cleaning Steps Performed

- Loaded dataset and explored null values
- Replaced missing `Age` with median
- Replaced missing `Embarked` with mode
- Dropped `Cabin` due to excessive missing values
- Verified that all missing values were handled

# What I Learned

- Importance of handling missing data before ML
- How to clean categorical and numerical features
- Using `.fillna()` effectively for imputation
- The role of visual validation via `.isnull().sum()`

 Next Steps (Not Included Here)

- Encode categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Normalize numeric features (`Age`, `Fare`)
- Outlier detection with boxplots
- Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
